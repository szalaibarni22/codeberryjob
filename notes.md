# Notes

## Step 1: Setup

- Create the GitHub repo
- Create the .html, .js files - for now on, we won't need a CSS file
- try to commit and check if it works well

## Step 2: What are we going to build?

- A To-Do App with:
   - a title
   - an input field
   - an Add button
   (probably we can do all of these in just the HTML)

   -then we will need:
      - the button to take action: to make a new list element and show it in the page
      - we will need a Delete button - which deletes the item
      - we will need a Complete button - which turns the item in italics, faded, strikethrough format
      - we can reach that Enter key does the same as a click on the add button


## Problems occured during the building process
 - It's easy to make permanent buttons, but how to make them on the fly in JS?
